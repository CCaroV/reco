Reco is an audio recording app designed for elementary OS.

One day when I joined a discussion in my department I had to take a minutes with my elementary laptop. The discussion was so high-paced that I couldn't hear and write down everything into the minutes. After coming back home I searched whether there was a sound recorder designed for elementary OS but I couldn't find, althought there were some non-elementary apps like GNOME Sound Recorder. I decided to create one designed for and fits in elementary OS.

Actually, however, I don't have much experience of programming, although I know a little bit about Java. So this app will be published after I learned programming moreâ€¦
